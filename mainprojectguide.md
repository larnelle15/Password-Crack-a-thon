The main goal of this project is to crack 250 passwords. You might ask why I'm not aiming at cracking more than that but the truth is with all of these methods i'm going to implement, cracking up to 1000 passwords is very possible but would take a long time and is unnecessary.
We want to use john commands to use multiple different wordlists
use built-in john rulesets
, and use custom-made rules
The cp_leak.txt file will be the file with the password hashes we'll be using and I'll be using the lower.lst and rockyou.txt wordlists.
I'll use mainly wordlist mode and auto mode for this project.
My use of these are mainly to make the passwords cracked goal in the shortest time.
