# Password-Crack-a-thon
For this project, I'll be working with a (fictional) leaked password file, modeled after famous data breaches such as the 2012 LinkedIn Hack and 2016 Yahoo Data Breaches. In both of these incidents, usernames and hashed passwords were leaked in simple txt files, making people's private data available to anyone who could crack the hashes.

 I'm going to crack as many hashes as possible, so those passwords can be removed from production and those users' accounts secured with the help of John the ripper commands
